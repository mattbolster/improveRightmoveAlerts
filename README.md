# rightmoveAlert
A near-instantaneous alert system for MacOS to use with rightmove.co.uk when searching for new listings.

## General info
I found that rightmove.co.uk's 'instant alert' feature didn't work as expected so in order to get instantaneous alerts I had to improvise...

This python script is intended to be run in the Terminal app on MacOS. To find terminal: launchpad -> other -> Terminal. Alternatively you can use cmd + space to bring up spotlight search where you can search for Terminal.
Basic knowledge of Terminal commands is assumed.

## Setup:
1. In Terminal, navigate to the directory in which the file was downloaded.
2. Run the script using the command: 
```
$ python rightmoveAlert.py
```

3. Follow the on screen prompt and paste in the URL from your rightmove.co.uk property search
4. Minimise the terminal window if you like and ensure your volume is unmutted
5. Get notifications when a new property is added to rightmove and contact the agent fast before the viewings are gone
